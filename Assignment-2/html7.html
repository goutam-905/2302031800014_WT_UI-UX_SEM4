            <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
            <p>
                Based in Dallas, Texas, the PlantTAGG® team has been at the forefront of technology innovation for consumers, brands, and retailers for over 15 years. 
                We are driven by a passion to improve the success of gardeners of all levels who want plant ownership through technology innovation. 
                PlantTAGG is a data and AI-driven platform comprising key academic partnerships, including certified Master Gardeners, Master Naturalists, 
                Texas A&M AgriLife Research, North Carolina State University, the US Department of Agriculture, NOAA, and a wealth of global horticulture experts and data scientists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our mission is to provide the gardening community the ability to deliver a highly localized and accurate experience that helps new gardeners 
                be successful and empowers existing gardeners to find the right plant information. 
                As gardeners use PlantTAGG, the system becomes smarter, helping to inform and provide problem-solving insights to the gardening community. 
                A lack of information is the primary problem – we believe that the future success of the gardening market hinges on data accessibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                To solve the problem, we have brought together a diverse group of gardeners, plant experts, horticulturalists, and data scientists 
                to build a world-changing platform. It's no small feat, but we are making it happen – come join us on the journey!
